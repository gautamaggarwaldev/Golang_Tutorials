	The steep stony path
	That took us up from Rajpur,
	Toiling and sweating
	And grumbling at the climb,
	But enjoying it all the same.
	At first the hills were hot and bare,
	But then there were trees near Jharipani
	And we stopped at the Halfway House
	And swallowed lungfuls of diamond-cut air.
	Then onwards, upwards, to the town,
	Our appetites to repair!
	Well, no one uses that old road any more.
	Walking is out of fashion now.
	And if you have a car to take you
	Swiftly up the motor-road
	Why bother to toil up a disused path?
	You’d have to be an old romantic like me
	To want to take that route again.`)
